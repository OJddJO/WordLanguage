WordLanguage is a programming language designed to minimize the use of symbols, making it easy to read and write. Its syntax is simple and closely resembles natural language, aiming to be both easy to learn and powerful enough for complex programming tasks.

**Key Features**:
- Minimal Symbols: Uses the least amount of symbols possible.
- Natural Language Syntax: Designed to be as close to natural language as possible.
- Ease of Use: Easy to learn and use, suitable for beginners and advanced users alike.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install WordLanguage, just download the latest release [here](https://github.com/OJddJO/WordLanguage/releases/latest) and you're good to go.

### Usage

To run a WordLanguage program, simply run the `word` executable with the path to the program file as an argument. Like this: 

```bash
./word.exe path/to/program.w
```

### Creating your first program

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in WordLanguage:

```
print "Hello, World!"
```

Save this code to a file named `hello.w` and run it with the `word` executable:

```bash
./word.exe hello.w
```

You should see the output `Hello, World!` printed to the console.

Now you're ready to start writing your own WordLanguage programs!
