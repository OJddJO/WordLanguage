# Operations
> [!NOTE]
> ***Operations*** are the basic building blocks of the language. They are the smallest unit of code that can be executed. They can be combined to form ***expressions*** which can be used to perform more complex operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ***Operations*** do follow the mathematical order of operations. To enforce a specific order of operations, use `.`. For example, `2 plus 3 time 4` will be evaluated as `5 * 4 = 20` then `2 + 3 = 5`. To evaluate `2 + 3` first, use `2 .plus 3 time 4`.

| Expression | Description |
|---|---|
| `a plus b` | Add `a` and `b` |
| `a minus b` | Subtract `b` from `a` |
| `a time b` | Multiply `a` and `b` |
| `a div b` | Divide `a` by `b` |
| `a mod b` | Remainder of `a` divided by `b` |
| `a ediv b` | Euclidean division of `a` by `b` |
| `a power b` | `a` raised to the power of `b` |
| `sqrt b` | square root of `b` |
| `a .plus b time c` | `a + b` times `c` (priority) |
