# Operations
> ***Operations*** are the basic building blocks of the language. They are the smallest unit of code that can be executed. They can be combined to form ***expressions*** which can be used to perform more complex operations.

| Expression | Description | Types |
|---|---|---|
| `a plus b` | Add `a` and `b` | int, float, str |
| `a minus b` | Subtract `b` from `a` | int, float |
| `a times b` | Multiply `a` and `b` | int, float |
| `a div b` | Divide `a` by `b` | int, float |
| `a mod b` | Remainder of `a` divided by `b` | int |
| `a ediv b` | Euclidean division of `a` by `b` | int |
| `a power b` | `a` raised to the power of `b` | `a`: int, float `b`: int |
| `a root b` | `a`th root of `b` | int |
| `a .plus b times c` | `a + b` times `c` (priority) | int, float |
