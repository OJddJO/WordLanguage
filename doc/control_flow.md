# Control Flow
Control flow statements are used to control the flow of the program. They are used to make decisions and to repeat code blocks.

## Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to make decisions in the code. They evaluate a ***boolean expression*** and execute a block of code if the expression is true. You can use `if`, `elif`, `else`, `endif` to create conditional statements.

| Expression | Description |
|---|---|
| `if a equal b do` | If `a` is equal to `b`, do |
| `if not a gEqual b and c equals a plus b do` | If `a` is not greater than or equal to `b` and `c` is equal to `a+b`, do |
| `elif a equal b do` | Else if `a` is equal to `b`, do |
| `else` | Else |
| `endif` | End if |

## Loops
Loops are used to repeat code blocks. You can use `for` and `while` loops to repeat code blocks. You can use `break` to exit a loop and `endloop` to end a loop.

| Expression | Description |
|---|---|
| `for i in range 1 to 10 do` | Loop from 1 to 10 |
| `for i in range 1 to 10 step 2 do` | Loop from 1 to 10 with a step of 2 |
| `for i in range 10 to 1 step -1 do` | Loop from 10 to 1 with a step of -1 |
| `while <boolean expression> do` | While the `boolean expression` is verified (example: `a less b`) , do |
| `break` | Break loop |
| `endloop` | End loop |
