# Benchmark

This directory contains the benchmarking code for the project. The benchmarking code is written in Python and uses the `timeit` module to measure the time taken to execute the same code written in Python and WordLanguage. (see [benchmark.py](benchmark.py))

## Output

> Python: 349.520957 s for 1000 iterations (avg: 0.034952 s/iter) \
> Word: 37.664156 s for 1000 iterations (avg: 0.003766 s/iter) \
> Ratio python/word: 9.28x
